Face Blur is an open source tool created for protesters and reporters to protect their privacy. Face Blur uses OpenCv and Harr Cascade Algorithm to batch detect identifiable faces in any photos, and then blur the detected area. 

The script will automatically read all the photos in the desired directory, make copies, process all the photos and export the blurred versions and keep the originals.

This project was designed to streamline photo editing process in order support and aid photo journalism while protecting protesters' identities and privacy.
